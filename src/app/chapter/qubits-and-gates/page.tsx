        In this chapter we&apos;ll begin to take a look at the fundamental
        building blocks of quantum computation
      </p>
      <p>
        We&apos;ll introduce the notion of quantum bits, the fundamental unit of
        quantum information, and how we can manipulate them with gates in order
        to achieve meaninful computation.
